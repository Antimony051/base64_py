# Base64 Encoder and Decoder in Python

This Python project includes scripts for "manual" encoding and decoding of the Base64 encoding scheme.

## Description

The project consists of two Python scripts: `encode.py` and `decode.py`, which perform Base64 encoding and decoding, respectively.

### `encode.py`

The `encode.py` script encodes a user-provided string into its Base64 representation.

#### Usage

1. Run `encode.py`.
2. Enter the string you want to encode when prompted.
3. The script will output the Base64 encoded string.

### `decode.py`

The `decode.py` script decodes a Base64 encoded string back to its original form.

#### Usage

1. Run `decode.py`.
2. Input the Base64 encoded string when prompted.
3. The script will output the decoded string.
